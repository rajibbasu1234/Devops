**Prompt:
Develop a demonstration project utilizing Terraform to deploy a basic application (any basic CRUD application) on either Google Cloud Platform (GCP) or Amazon Web Services (AWS). This project should include network configuration and utilize a secret management tool alongside Docker and Kubernetes.**

## Setup AWS Account and Credentials:
Create an AWS account if you don't have one already.
Generate Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for programmatic access.
## Install Terraform:
Download and install Terraform from the official website.
## Configure AWS Provider in Terraform:
Configure AWS credentials in Terraform using the Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
## Network Configuration:
Define Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform.
Create subnets, route tables, internet gateways, and security groups as needed.
Define network ACLs to control traffic flow.
## Secret Management:
Utilize AWS Secrets Manager to store sensitive information such as database credentials.
Create a secret for the database credentials using Terraform.
## Docker Configuration:
Dockerize your basic CRUD application.
Write a Dockerfile to package your application into a container.
## Kubernetes Setup:
Deploy Kubernetes cluster using Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) or a tool like kops or eksctl.
Configure kubectl to interact with the Kubernetes cluster.
Create Kubernetes manifests (YAML files) for deploying your application pods, services, and any necessary volumes or configurations.
## Deploy Application:
Use Terraform to deploy the Kubernetes manifests onto the EKS cluster.
Ensure that the application pods are running and accessible within the cluster.
## Testing:
Test the functionality of your CRUD application to ensure it's working as expected.
Verify that the application can communicate with the database securely using the credentials stored in AWS Secrets Manager.
## Cleanup:
After completing the demonstration, tear down the infrastructure using Terraform to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
